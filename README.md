## Key Use Cases

### Library Books → Kindle
Download from Libby/OverDrive → Import to Folio → One-click "Send to Kindle" → Reading in 60 seconds

### Public Domain Books → Any Device
Download EPUBs → Folio organizes with covers → Transfer wirelessly via browser → Done

### Format Conversion
Have an EPUB, need MOBI? Folio converts automatically when sending to Kindle.

### Multiple Formats, One View
Have the same book in EPUB and MOBI? Folio groups them as one item, showing all format badges.

## Architecture

Folio is built as a **4-layer cake** where data flows strictly downward:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VIEWS (what users see)                     │  SwiftUI — grid, table, sidebar
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SERVICES (what coordinates things)         │  LibraryService — the "brain"
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  REPOSITORIES (what talks to the database)  │  BookRepository — CRUD on books
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CORE DATA (the database)                   │  6 entities: Book, Author, Series...
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Two Modules

- **`Folio/`** — the macOS app (SwiftUI views, state management, UI models)
- **`FolioCore/`** — a Swift Package with **zero UI code** (HTTP server, metadata APIs, Kindle email, format conversion, Bonjour). An iOS app can reuse all of this.

### The Key Abstraction: BookGroup

Users don't see files — they see *books*. If you have `Dune.epub` and `Dune.mobi`, Folio groups them into **one BookGroup** with two format badges. Grouping happens by ISBN first, falling back to normalized title. Every UI surface works with BookGroups, not raw Book entities.

### Core UX Loop

```
User drops files → ImportService saves to Core Data → BookGroupingService groups them
→ Grid/Table displays BookGroups → .task modifier auto-fetches metadata → Cover appears
```

### Key Files

| File | What It Controls |
|------|-----------------|
| `ContentView.swift` | Main layout — sidebar + content, toolbar, all state |
| `BookGroupViews.swift` | How books look in the grid — covers, badges, context menus |
| `BookTableView.swift` | Table view with sortable column headers |
| `BookGroup.swift` | How files become visual "books," format priority |
| `SortOption.swift` | Sort options and their default directions |
| `LibraryService.swift` | Facade — one door to all business logic |
| `BookRepository.swift` | All Core Data operations |
| `FormatStyle.swift` | Color gradients and icons per format |

### Dependencies (only 3)

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [Swifter](https://github.com/httpswift/swifter) | HTTP server for WiFi transfer |
| [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) | Image caching for cover downloads |
| [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) | JSON parsing for API responses |

Everything else is native Apple frameworks (Core Data, Network.framework, Core Image, SwiftUI).
